## Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study

Cyclistic is a bike-share firm founded in 2016. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy has relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that has helped make this possible is the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, while customers who purchase annual memberships are referred to as Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify trends.

In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, and Moreno has tasked me with finding the differences between these user groups.
